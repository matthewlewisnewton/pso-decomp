# Porting exceptions register

Every place where the source is not plain portable C/C++ because matching the
GameCube binary needs it: assembly, CodeWarrior-only intrinsics and pragmas,
direct hardware access, per-unit compiler overrides, and approved regressions.
A port to another platform must rewrite or neutralize every entry here.

The mechanical inventory (each line and file) is generated into
[porting-exceptions-generated.md](porting-exceptions-generated.md):

    python3 tools/list_port_exceptions.py           # regenerate
    python3 tools/list_port_exceptions.py --check   # fail if stale
    python3 tools/list_port_exceptions.py --pr N    # list exceptions added by open PR N

Reasons are cited only where a file, PR or approval records one; otherwise the
entry says *reason not recorded*.

## Rule for assembly

If assembly is approved, a scalar C/C++ equivalent ships next to it (Matt,
2026-11-04). The asm is guarded for the GameCube/MWCC build (`#ifdef __MWERKS__`)
and the scalar version is the compiled fallback, so a port builds the C. Approved
asm always has an entry in this register.

## 1. Assembly

| File | Function | What | Why | Port should |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `src/musyx/runtime/Chorus/chorus_fx.c` | `do_src1`, `do_src2` | `asm` body from `orig_asm` include | Library code shipped as assembly; covered by the CONTRIBUTING `orig_asm` rule for vendor assembly. No specific evidence doc. | Write scalar C fallback (none exists yet); MusyX upstream C sources are a reference. |
| `src/musyx/runtime/StdReverb/reverb.c` | `DoCrossTalk`, `HandleReverb` | `asm` body from `orig_asm` include | Same as above. | Same: scalar C fallback needed (none exists yet). |

These four predate the scalar-fallback rule and have **no C fallback**.

## 2. MWCC intrinsics

`__cntlzw` (55), `__frsqrte` (11), `__fabsf` (6), `__fabs` (4), `__rlwinm` (4),
`__abs` (1), `__builtin_va_info` (1); full list in the generated file. Reason: they
reproduce single PowerPC instructions the original compiled code used; no
per-site reason is recorded.

Port should: `__fabsf`/`__fabs` → `fabsf`/`fabs`; `__abs` → `abs`; `__cntlzw` →
a count-leading-zeros helper (`__builtin_clz` with a zero check, returns 32 for 0);
`__frsqrte` → `1.0 / sqrt(x)` (the Newton refinement loops around it then become
redundant but harmless); `__rlwinm` → shift/rotate + mask; `__builtin_va_info` →
standard `va_start`.

## 3. Direct hardware access

13 files write the GX write-gather pipe at `0xCC008000` directly (inlined
`GXPosition*`/`GXColor*` style emission), e.g. `TObjPlayer_803E21B8.cpp`,
`TObjLight_803DF220.cpp`, `text_803E2D70.cpp` (32 hits), `ChunkMaterialState.cpp`.
Reason not recorded per site; it mirrors the SDK's inline GX macros. Port should:
route through the GX abstraction of the target renderer (call `GXPosition3f32`
etc. or their port equivalents) instead of the fixed address.

## 4. CodeWarrior pragmas

5,865 pragmas in 885 files; per-file table in the generated file. Main kinds:
`dont_inline` 1153, `inline_depth` 1045, `fp_contract` 932, `auto_inline` 844,
`opt_common_subs` 624, `scheduling` 262, `opt_propagation` 239,
`readonly_strings` 203, `peephole` 104, `optimization_level` 88, `bool` 56,
`defer_codegen` 50, `pack` 46. Reason: reproduce the original code generation
and emission order; individual pragmas generally carry no recorded reason.

Port should: drop optimization/scheduling/inlining pragmas (they only steer
MWCC). **Keep the semantics** of `pack` (use the target's packing attribute and
check struct layout), `bool`, and `fp_contract` where float results must match
bit-for-bit (`fp_contract on` means fused multiply-add was used; a port may see
small float differences without FMA).

## 5. Per-unit compiler overrides (`configure.py`)

144 units override the default `GAME_COMPILER = "GC/2.6"`/`cflags_pso` in
`GAME_EXCEPTIONS` or the `MIDDLEWARE` table: other MWCC versions (GC/1.2.5,
1.2.5n, 1.3, 1.3.2, 2.0) and switches (`-inline deferred`, `-fp_contract on`,
`-str reuse,readonly`, `-sdata 4`, `-opt nocse`, `-use_lmw_stmw off`, ...). The
`configure.py` comment above each entry is its recorded reason (e.g.
`pso_date.cpp`: GC/1.3.2 scheduling, see
[calendar-conversion-evidence.md](evidence/calendar-conversion-evidence.md);
`TObjTombstone.cpp`: `-fp_contract on` because two calculations fuse
multiply-adds). The generated table copies each comment; 93 entries have no
comment of their own (several share a comment with the entry above). Library
groups (SDK, runtime, TRK, MusyX, CRI, Ginja, mcFs, ntInf, avetcp, modem, ntUtl)
use their own compiler versions as recorded there.

Port should: build everything with one modern compiler. Only `-fp_contract on`
(float results) and deferred emission order (no semantic effect) need thought;
nothing else changes behaviour.

## 6. Approved regressions

| Function | Match | Why | Port should |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deform_indirect_texture_scroll` in `src/pso/effect/TEffIndirectCtrl_802A88AC.cpp` ([#291](https://github.com/matthewlewisnewton/pso-decomp/pull/291)) | 99.78723% of 564 bytes (100% on main) | Approved by Matt on 2026-11-04. Main is exact only because of a cancelling `off16++; off16--;` in the line loop. One `off16 = offset` before the axis loop is copy-propagated into a temporary allocated in r30 (`extsh r30,r4`) instead of the named short in r28. Constructors, a base-class `s16`, and same-TU helpers scalar-replace to that same temporary. A second store is what keeps r28, and that store is steering, so it stays removed. The function is still 141 instructions; six register operands differ. | Nothing to rewrite. This source is the portable one. The mismatch is register allocation only. |
